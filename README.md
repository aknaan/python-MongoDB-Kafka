# python-MongoDB-Kafka

In this project I implemented the following steps:
1. Wrote an app in python that allows to buy items and present a list of bought items
2. The app is built from a client server that handles the buy request, and produce data object to Kafka to consume
3. Kafka consume the messages 
4. API server is adding the items to the db from kafka and define the endpoints
